# Calculator
 Excited to share my latest projectâ€”a fully functional calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! ðŸŽ‰  This calculator can handle basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also has a responsive design that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.  ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:  HTML & CSS for structure and styling  JavaScript for the logic (no external librariesâ€”just pure code!)
